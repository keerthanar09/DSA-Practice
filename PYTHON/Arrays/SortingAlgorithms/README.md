## Bubble Sort

 - Sorting strings is different from sorting numbers, since strings behave differently due to lexicography. Always convert input to `int` while sorting numbers!

 - Time complexity: O(n^2) - bubble sort is very slow and impractical for large datasets, and is only usually used academically to demonstrate different sorting techniques. 
 
 - Space complexity: O(1)
